Prasad Golla Durga -Section 02 - Dr Denise Case

I am a Graduate student pursuing MS-ACS (Master of Science in Applied Computer Science). This is my first semester here at Northwest Missouri State University. 

I am from Bangalore , Karnataka, India. I completed my Under Graduation in Karavali Institute of Technology, Mangalore, which comes under VTU (Visveswaraiah Technological University). My hobbies are playing badminton, cricket, football, handball, PC and mobile games. I have done mini projects on web design, DBMS and worked as an intern for one month in Hornbill.ltd on Android Development.

I want to work as a full time developer in Google, in the field of web development, Machine Learning.

At first I seem to be a serious kind of person but when I get to know people, I  will be really friendly. I have served as a captain to my college team for Handball, and been a president for Computer Science dept in my under graduation for 2 years.
